Cody Brewer is a useless pile of meat and bones that doesn't have the courage to end his life like he should. He has had plenty of people come into his life and provide him with opportunities to be a better person but instead he has just become a worthless piece of shit. He left his last job after failing to kill himself and has been failing at getting another job, functioning in day to day life, having basic conversations, and of course at killing himself. It's mostly because he is an idiot and can't figure it out but hey stupid creatures die all the time it's inevitable that this one will soon too.
